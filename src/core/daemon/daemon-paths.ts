/**
 * Cross-platform paths for the per-workspace mcp-graph daemon.
 *
 * Each workspace gets its own state directory keyed by a short hash of its
 * absolute path — workspaces stay isolated from each other, and paths stay
 * short enough to fit inside the Unix `sockaddr_un.sun_path` limit (104 bytes
 * on macOS/BSD, 108 on Linux).
 *
 * Layout:
 *   $HOME/.mcp-graph/<hash>/
 *     daemon.sock   (Unix socket — macOS/Linux)
 *     daemon.pid    (liveness pidfile)
 *     daemon.log    (stderr tail for debugging)
 *
 * On Windows the socket becomes a named pipe at `\\.\pipe\mcp-graph-<hash>`
 * (pipes have no filesystem counterpart, so only pidFile/logFile live in
 * the state dir).
