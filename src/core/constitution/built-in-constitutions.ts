/**
 * Built-in constitution bundles shipped with mcp-graph.
 *
 * Each bundle is a curated set of governing principles installable via
 * `constitution(action: "install_builtin", name: "<bundle-name>")`. Bundles
 * are immutable definitions; install creates a constitution node carrying
 * a copy of the principles + a `builtinName` marker for idempotency.
 *
 * Adding a bundle: append a `BuiltinConstitution` to `BUILTINS` and export
 * a `*_NAME` constant for the public ID.
