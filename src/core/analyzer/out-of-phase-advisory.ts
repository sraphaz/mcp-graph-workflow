 * §EPIC-13.4 — Out-of-Phase Advisory Wrapper used by analyze() modes
 * that are DESIGN-specific (traceability, coupling, interfaces,
 * tech_risk, design_ready). When called outside DESIGN, the result is
 * wrapped in an `advisory: true` envelope with a `phaseWarning`,
 * signalling the caller that the report should NOT trigger gate
 * enforcement.
 *
 * In DESIGN, the report is returned flat (spread at the top level) so
 * existing call sites that read fields directly continue to work.
