/**
 * Harness Savings Calculator — pure arithmetic for "tokens saved when the
 * harness blocked an action".
 *
 * Per Eduardo's spec (2026-04-30): every time the harness blocks an action
 * that would have led to a hallucination / quality drop / context loss, the
 * graph records — with real metrics — how many tokens were saved. The DB
 * lookup that turns a session id into `tokensConsumed` and the past-rows
 * average that turns a `blockType` into `baselineContinuation` live in
 * `savings-ledger.ts`. This module only combines them.
 *
 * Grounding: Hu et al. 2026 ("Memory in the Age of AI Agents"), §4 —
 * the ledger is *factual memory* (records environment events) plus
 * *experiential memory* (each savings row teaches future blocks how much
 * the next intervention is likely to save).
