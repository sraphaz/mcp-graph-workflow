 * Pipeline:
 *   L0: Check suppression store → skip suppressed (file, violationType) pairs
 *   L1: Match violation against rules via violationType → find matching rule
 *   L2: Resolve template with actual file/line/evidence → create suggestion
 *   L3: Validate confidence >= 0.8 → filter low-confidence
 *   Sort by priority desc → return
 *
 * Part of the Zero False-Positive guarantee (5 layers).
