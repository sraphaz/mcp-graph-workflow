# to-prd

Port of `skills-main/to-prd` adapted for mcp-graph: the output is consumed by `import_prd` (or filed as a GitHub issue when the user already runs spec-kit).

## When to use

You have an exploratory conversation that's converged on a feature, but no PRD node exists in the graph yet. Stop coding. Synthesize first.

## Process

1. **Explore the repo** if you haven't already — `query_graph`, `code_intelligence` for callers.
2. **Sketch deep modules**: list the modules you will build/modify. Prefer deep modules (simple interface, lots of behavior, rarely changes) over shallow facades.
3. **Confirm** module boundaries with the user; ask which modules they want test coverage for.
4. **Write the PRD** using the template below, then `import_prd` it as a draft epic.

## PRD template

```markdown
## Problem Statement
The user's pain, in the user's words.

## Solution
What changes from the user's perspective.

## User Stories
1. As a <actor>, I want <feature>, so that <benefit>
… long, exhaustive list

## Implementation Decisions
- Modules to build/modify (no file paths — they rot)
- Module interfaces
- Architectural decisions, schema changes, API contracts

## Testing Decisions
- What "good test" means here (test behavior, not implementation)
- Modules to test
- Prior art (similar tests already in the codebase)

## Out of Scope
What this PRD does NOT cover.

## Further Notes
Anything else.
```

## Anti-patterns

- Interviewing the user from scratch when context already exists
- Pasting file paths or code into the PRD (they go stale)
- Single mega-story instead of many user stories
