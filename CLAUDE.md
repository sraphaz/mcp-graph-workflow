# CLAUDE.md — mcp-graph

## Overview

`mcp-graph` is a local-first CLI tool (TypeScript) that converts PRD text files into persistent execution graphs (SQLite), with an integrated knowledge store, RAG pipeline, and multi-agent integration mesh — enabling structured, token-efficient agentic workflows.

## Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x — strict mode, ESNext modules
- **Runtime:** Node.js ≥ 18 (no Docker, no external infra)
- **CLI:** Commander.js v14
- **Validation:** Zod v4 (`import { z } from 'zod/v4'`)
- **Testing:** Vitest v4
- **Search:** FTS5 + BM25 + TF-IDF (100% local)
- **Dashboard:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS + React Flow
- **Build:** `tsc` → `dist/` | Dev: `tsx`

See [docs/INTEGRATIONS-GUIDE.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS-GUIDE.md).

## Non-Regression Rule

**MANDATORY — applies to every change, no exceptions.**

### Verification Gate (run ALL before delivering)

1. **Build** — `npm run build` must succeed. Compilation passing ≠ type check passing (ESM resolution, missing exports, bundler issues are caught here, not by `tsc --noEmit`).
2. **Type check** — `npm run typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`) must report zero errors.
3. **Test suite** — `npm test` must pass with zero failures. Zero tolerance for regressions.
4. **Linter** — `npm run lint` (if configured) must report no new violations.
5. **Smoke test** — if the project has a CLI or server, run it once (`npm run dev -- --help` or equivalent) and confirm it starts without crashing.

### Behavioral Guardrails

6. **Do not remove, rename, or change the signature** of any existing public function, type, or export unless the task explicitly requires it. If you must change a public API, find and update ALL callers/importers first.
7. **Do not remove or modify re-exports** (barrel `index.ts` files) without verifying no external module depends on them.
8. **Do not delete tests** unless the feature they cover is being intentionally removed.
9. **Do not change behavior of code you didn't intend to touch.** If a refactor, bugfix, or new feature inadvertently alters unrelated behavior, revert the unintended change.

### Schema & Data Integrity

10. **Schema changes must be backward-compatible** with existing persisted data (JSON files, SQLite rows, API contracts). If a field is removed or renamed, provide migration or handle both old and new format.
11. **Do not remove or downgrade dependencies** without verifying no module imports them. Adding deps requires explicit user request.

### Configuration Guard

12. **Do not relax strictness settings** — never change `strict: true` to `false`, never disable linter rules, never lower test coverage thresholds. If a strict check blocks your work, fix the code, don't weaken the check.

### If anything fails

13. **Stop and fix before proceeding.** Never deliver code that breaks existing functionality. Never skip a failing check with `--no-verify`, `@ts-ignore`, `// eslint-disable`, or equivalent without explicit user approval.

> The bar is simple: **after your change, everything that worked before must still work identically.**

## Testing & Quality Methodology

**MANDATORY — applies to all code production.**

### TDD First

All new code MUST follow Test-Driven Development (Red → Green → Refactor). Write the failing test BEFORE writing the implementation. No exceptions.

### Test Pyramid

Every feature/fix must include the appropriate level(s) of testing:

| Level | Scope | When Required | Data Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit tests** | Single function/module in isolation | Always — every public function | Use factories/builders that create minimal valid objects. NO massive mock datasets. |
| **Integration tests** | Multiple modules working together (DB, file I/O, pipelines) | When the feature involves cross-module interaction | Use real (lightweight) instances — temp files, in-memory SQLite, test containers. Mocks only at external boundaries. |
| **E2E tests** | Full CLI invocation or API request → response | When the feature adds/changes a user-facing command or endpoint | Use fixture files and real project data. Validate actual output. |
| **E2E browser tests** | Full frontend flow via real browser (Playwright/Cypress) | When the feature has a UI. Include A/B variant testing when applicable. | Use real browser, real DOM. Test user flows, not implementation. |
| **Shadow tests** | Run new code path in parallel with old, compare outputs without affecting users | When replacing or rewriting critical logic (parsers, calculators, pipelines) | Feed identical input to both paths, diff outputs, log divergences. |

### Mock Data Policy — DO NOT over-mock

- **Unit tests:** Use factory functions that create ONE minimal valid object with sensible defaults. Override only the fields relevant to the test. Never generate large mock datasets "just in case."
- **Integration tests:** Prefer real lightweight instances (temp files, in-memory DB) over mocks. Mock ONLY external systems you don't control (third-party APIs, paid services).
- **E2E tests:** Use real fixtures. Zero mocks — the point is to test the real system.
- **General rule:** If you need more than 5 lines to set up mock data for a single test, the test or the code is too coupled. Refactor first.

### Observability & Log Coverage

- Every new module must use the project logger — never raw `console.log`/`print`.
- Log coverage is part of the review: entry points (info), error paths (error + stack), external calls (debug with timing).
- Structured log fields must be queryable (key=value or JSON, not free-text sentences).

### Code Review Checklist (self-review before delivering)

Before marking any task as done, self-review against:
- [ ] Tests written BEFORE implementation (TDD)?
- [ ] All test levels appropriate for this change are covered?
- [ ] No unnecessary mocks — real instances where possible?
- [ ] Logger used in all significant code paths?
- [ ] Error handling includes typed errors + stack trace preservation?
- [ ] No dead code, no commented-out code, no TODO without a linked issue?
- [ ] Build + type check + test suite + linter all pass?

## Critical Conventions

1. **ESM only** — always use `.js` extension in relative imports
2. **Zod v4** — `import { z } from 'zod/v4'` (never `'zod'`)
3. **Strict TS** — no `any`, explicit return types on public functions
4. **Kebab-case files** — `graph-store.ts`, not `graphStore.ts`
5. **PascalCase types** — `GraphNode`, `NodeStatus`
6. **camelCase functions** — `findNextTask()`, `buildTaskContext()`
7. **Typed errors** — use `src/core/utils/errors.ts`, never throw raw strings
8. **Logger** — use `src/core/utils/logger.ts`, never `console.log`
9. **Infer from Zod** — `z.infer<typeof Schema>` instead of duplicating types
10. **Tests** — TDD, arrange-act-assert, files in `src/tests/`

## Path-Specific Rules

Detailed rules per directory are in `.claude/rules/`:

| Rule File | Scope |
|---|---|
| `typescript.md` | `src/**/*.ts` — strict mode, ESM, Zod |
| `cli.md` | `src/cli/**/*.ts` — thin orchestration |
| `core.md` | `src/core/**/*.ts` — pure functions, typed errors |
| `schemas.md` | `src/schemas/**/*.ts` — Zod v4 patterns |
| `tests.md` | `tests/**/*.test.ts` — Vitest, arrange-act-assert |

## XP Anti-Vibe-Coding Workflow

This project follows an anti-vibe-coding methodology based on XP (Extreme Programming):

- **New projects**: Use `/xp-bootstrap` for the sequential workflow (Isolation → Foundation → TDD → Implementation → Optimization → Interface → Deploy)
- **Project setup**: Use `/project-scaffold` to auto-generate `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md` template, and `.claude/rules/`
- **Continuous cycle**: Use `/dev-flow-orchestrator` for ongoing iterations (ANALYZE → DESIGN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REVIEW → HANDOFF → LISTENING)
- **Graph sync**: Use `/track-with-mcp-graph` to keep the execution graph in sync with real work
- **Dev lifecycle**: See [docs/LIFECYCLE.md](docs/LIFECYCLE.md) for the 8-phase cycle (ANALYZE → DESIGN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REVIEW → HANDOFF → LISTENING)

Key principles:
1. **Build to Earning vs Learning** — Production code (Build to Earning) = full discipline, no shortcuts. Side projects (Build to Learning) = experimentation allowed. Know which mode you're in.
2. **Skeleton & Organs** — Dev defines architecture, AI implements. Never "create a SaaS" — define stack, services, domain first.
3. **Anti-one-shot** — Never use a single prompt to generate entire systems. Decompose into atomic tasks tracked in the graph.
4. **TDD enforced** — Tests before code. If AI suggests a feature without a test: REFUSE.
5. **Code detachment** — If the AI made a mistake, explain the error via prompt — never edit manually. Document error patterns in CLAUDE.md.
6. **CLAUDE.md as evolving spec** — Every error, pattern, or architectural decision must be documented to cumulatively train the agent.
7. **Graph visualization** — Use `export_mermaid` to visualize the execution graph in reviews, handoffs, and debugging.

See [docs/LIFECYCLE.md](docs/LIFECYCLE.md) for the full methodology guide.

# Code Intelligence

Native code analysis engine at `src/core/code/`. Provides symbol-level understanding of the codebase without external MCP dependencies.

## What It Does

- **Symbol analysis** — Extracts functions, classes, methods, and interfaces from TypeScript source via AST parsing
- **Relationship tracking** — Maps calls, imports, exports, and implements relationships between symbols
- **Impact analysis** — Graph traversal to find upstream/downstream dependents (blast radius)
- **FTS5 search** — Full-text search across all indexed symbols
- **Execution flow detection** — Identifies process flows (e.g., CLI command → core function → store)

## Module Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ts-analyzer.ts` | TypeScript AST analysis — extracts symbols and relationships from source files |
| `code-indexer.ts` | Indexes the entire codebase into SQLite (symbols + relationships) |
| `code-store.ts` | SQLite storage and queries for symbols and relationships |
| `code-search.ts` | FTS5 search + graph-based queries across indexed symbols |
| `graph-traversal.ts` | Upstream/downstream traversal for impact analysis |
| `process-detector.ts` | Detects execution flows across the codebase |

## Dashboard

The **Code Graph** tab in the dashboard visualizes symbols, relationships, and execution flows. API routes at `src/api/routes/code-graph.ts`.

## Usage

The code index is stored in `workflow-graph/` alongside the execution graph. It is rebuilt by the `reindex_knowledge` MCP tool or via the dashboard.

## mcp-graph Execution Rule

**MANDATORY — applies to every task the AI performs, no exceptions.**

mcp-graph is the **single source of truth** for all work. The execution graph must reflect reality at all times. No implementation happens outside the graph.

### Before ANY implementation (Gate de Entrada)

1. **Node must exist** — before writing ANY code, the corresponding task node MUST exist in mcp-graph. Use `search` or `list` to find it. If it doesn't exist, create it with `node` (action: `add`) BEFORE touching any source file.
2. **Epic structure first** — when starting a new Epic or feature, create ALL nodes (Epic + child tasks) and ALL edges (dependencies) BEFORE implementing the first task. Use `import_prd` for PRDs or `node` (action: `add`) + `edge` for manual creation.
3. **Status = in_progress** — call `update_status` → `in_progress` BEFORE writing the first line of code for a task.
4. **Load context** — call `context` for the task to load compressed context (dependencies, RAG knowledge, related nodes). This informs the implementation.
5. **Use `next`** — always use `next` to get the recommended task based on priority + dependencies + knowledge coverage. Do NOT cherry-pick tasks unless the user explicitly requests a specific one.

### During implementation (Ciclo Obrigatório)

6. **The mandatory flow is: `next → context → [implement with TDD] → update_status → next`**. This cycle is NOT optional, NOT "recommended" — it is REQUIRED for every task.
7. **Phase-aware analysis** — use `analyze` with the appropriate mode for the current lifecycle phase:
   - IMPLEMENT: `tdd_check` (before coding), `implement_done` (after coding), `progress` (mid-sprint)
   - VALIDATE: `validate_ready`, `done_integrity`, `status_flow`
   - REVIEW: `review_ready`
8. **Save decisions** — use `write_memory` for important technical decisions, architectural patterns, or error patterns discovered during implementation.
9. **Validate completion** — use `validate` (action: `ac`) after completing each task to verify acceptance criteria are met.

### After implementation (Gate de Saída)

10. **Status = done** — call `update_status` → `done` ONLY after the task passes: tests green, build passes, AC validated.
11. **Never leave tasks in_progress** — if you stop working on a task (blocked, context switch), update status to `blocked` or `ready` as appropriate.
12. **Sprint tracking** — periodically use `analyze` mode `progress` to check burndown and velocity.

### Structural rules (Integridade do Grafo)

13. **Zero untracked work** — if a task doesn't have a node, CREATE IT FIRST. Every file change must trace back to a graph node.
14. **Dependencies matter** — use `edge` to declare dependencies between tasks. Never implement a task whose dependencies are not `done`.
15. **Knowledge pipeline** — use `rag_context` for deep context when needed. Use `reindex_knowledge` if the knowledge index seems stale.
16. **Graph visualization** — use `export` (format: `mermaid`) for reviews, handoffs, and debugging.

### Integration with other MCPs

17. **Context7** — use `sync_stack_docs` to ensure library docs are indexed before implementing features that depend on external libraries.
18. **Playwright** — use `validate` (action: `task`) for browser-based validation of UI tasks. Results auto-index into knowledge store.
19. **Code Intelligence** — use impact analysis and blast radius before modifying shared modules.

### If mcp-graph is unavailable

20. **Stop and diagnose** — if the mcp-graph MCP server is not responding, diagnose the issue BEFORE proceeding. Never fall back to working without the graph. Check `npx mcp-graph doctor` for environment validation.

### Quick reference checklist (every task)

- [ ] Node exists in graph? → if not, `node` (action: `add`)
- [ ] Dependencies satisfied? → `show` node, check deps
- [ ] Status updated to `in_progress`? → `update_status`
- [ ] Context loaded? → `context` or `rag_context`
- [ ] TDD test written FIRST? → Red → Green → Refactor
- [ ] AC validated? → `validate` (action: `ac`)
- [ ] Status updated to `done`? → `update_status`
- [ ] Technical decisions saved? → `write_memory`

> The bar is simple: **no node in the graph = no code written. The graph IS the work.**

### Fluxo de trabalho recomendado

```
next → context → [implementar com TDD] → update_status → next
```

### Lifecycle (8 fases)

1. **ANALYZE** — Criar PRD, definir requisitos (`import_prd`, `node`)
2. **DESIGN** — Arquitetura, decisões técnicas (`node`, `edge`, `analyze`)
3. **PLAN** — Sprint planning, decomposição (`plan_sprint`, `analyze`, `sync_stack_docs`)
4. **IMPLEMENT** — TDD Red→Green→Refactor (`next`, `context`, `update_status`, `analyze` — modes: implement_done, tdd_check, progress)
5. **VALIDATE** — Testes E2E, critérios de aceitação (`validate`, `metrics`)
6. **REVIEW** — Code review, blast radius (`export`, `metrics`)
7. **HANDOFF** — PR, documentação, entrega (`export`, `snapshot`)
8. **LISTENING** — Feedback, novo ciclo (`node`, `import_prd`)

### Pipeline de Conhecimento (Knowledge Store + RAG)

Fontes indexadas automaticamente:
- **Project memories** — ao escrever com `write_memory` (auto-indexa)
- **PRD imports** — ao importar com `import_prd`
- **Browser captures** — ao validar com `validate_task`
- **Stack docs** — ao sincronizar com `sync_stack_docs`
- **Sprint reports** — ao gerar com `plan_sprint`
- **Journey maps** — ao executar `journey { action: "index" }` ou `reindex_knowledge`

Recuperação: `rag_context` monta contexto phase-aware com budget de tokens:
- 60% contexto do grafo (nodes, deps, status)
- 30% knowledge store (BM25 + TF-IDF)
- 10% metadata de fase

Manual: `reindex_knowledge` para rebuild completo do índice.

### Princípios XP Anti-Vibe-Coding

- **TDD obrigatório** — Teste antes do código. Sem teste = sem implementação.
- **Anti-one-shot** — Nunca gere sistemas inteiros em um prompt. Decomponha em tasks atômicas.
- **Decomposição atômica** — Cada task deve ser completável em ≤2h.
- **Code detachment** — Se a IA errou, explique o erro via prompt. Nunca edite manualmente.
- **CLAUDE.md como spec evolutiva** — Documente padrões e decisões aqui.
